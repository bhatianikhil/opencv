# FIRE DETECTION USING A CAMERA

In furnaces and places where fire is required to do the daily routine work, it is difficult to detect a fire.
Heat sensors won't work because of enormous amount of heat used in these places. Thus, fire detection through a camera can be used.
In this project, the camera will take input images, blur the noise in the image and resize the image. After this, the programme
will fetch the red colour component from the image. The fetched component will be converted to HSV(high saturation value) to keep
only the natural components and blank the remianing image.
The HSV can be checked to be greater than a fixed value, if the value would be greater then the programme will show "YES" i.e.
there is a fire and if the value is smaller then it will show "NO" i.e. there is no fire.
All this is ran in a loop, so the images are continuously read and examined.
This programme therefore can be used at a lot of places and can make these places a lot safer.

Andhi aayi toofan aaya,
mar gayi saari chitiya,
lund choot ki hui ladai,
tatte maare sitia
